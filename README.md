This project is our Big Data Analysis course project named Super Trip Advisor. 
The objectives of this project include Big data analysis for both practical use and theoretical results: We used NYC transportation dataset to develop a web application for the recommendation of the waiting spot for taxi or uber in NYC, and for providing some other practically useful transportation information such as public transportation stops nearby and weather condition;

Also, we applied some algorithms including three types of Clustering algorithm and linear regression into the dataset for data visualization as well as obtaining some interesting feature out of them. We primarily utilize open source datasets including the NYC green taxi dataset, the NYC yellow taxi dataset and the NYC Uber dataset. The technologies involved in this project mainly include the data visualization package such as Pandas and Folium, data frame generator spark, data processing tool named MySQL workbench, and web application development framework named Flask for practical usage of processed data.

Particularly, this file including all our code for the final web application. We also include our data analysis results in the data anlysis folder.
